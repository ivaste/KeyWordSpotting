### [A neural attention model for speech command recognition](https://github.com/ivaste/KeyWordSpotting/blob/master/Literature/To%20Use/A%20neural%20attention%20model%20for%20speech%20command%20recognition.pdf)
 - python library kapre for mel-scale
 - Different tasks: 20 commands, 12 commands, 35 words, left-right
 - Training parameters
 - Accuracy 94%
 - 202K trainable parameters
 - Attention plots (log scale) to visualize what parts of the audio were most relevant
 - Confusion magrices
 - Try augmenting audio samples with background noise
 - Try using pretrained models
 - Try stack pair of words form more complex commands and use sequence to sequence model or multiple attention layers
